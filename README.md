## Architecture Overview

*Standard Agent* is a simple, modular library for building AI agents, with a composable core and plug‚Äëin components. 

It is *not* a complete agent with a nice user interface. It is a library that provides the core agent reasoning loop that bridges an LLM with tools, featuring a flexible design that allows you to swap out different LLMs, reasoning strategies, memory backends, and tool providers. A basic example CLI interface is provided, but you will generally have to provide your own system prompt, tool set and UI. [Jentic](https://jentic.com) can help with the tool set, but you can also roll your own.

![Standard Agent architecture](docs/assets/standard_agent_architecture.png)

It is deliberately small so it can be easily read and understood (whether by you or your coding agent), and used with confidence. This is a *less is more* approach to agent development. You can browse it to understand how agents work. You can use it to quickly build your own agents, skipping the boilerplate and focusing on business logic. 

*Standard Agent* excels when equipped with just-in-time tool loading, a paradigm that we advocate at [Jentic](https://jentic.com). This means dynamically loading (or "late-binding") tools at run-time depending on the specific goal or task at hand. This permits better context engineering, keeping the context uncluttered and the LLM focused on the tool details that matter, while eliminating practical limits on the number of tools that can be provided (here's a [blog post](https://jentic.com/blog/just-in-time-tooling) on the topic).

### Why Standard Agent?

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI (recommended)
pip install standard-agent

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/jentic/standard-agent.git
cd standard-agent
make install
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Configuration

Before running the agent, you need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project to store your API keys and other secrets. The application will automatically load these variables.

#### Quick Setup:
1. Copy the provided template: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Edit the `.env` file and replace placeholder values with your actual API keys
3. At minimum, you need one LLM provider key to get started
4. Add `JENTIC_AGENT_API_KEY` for out-of-the-box tool access (recommended)

See [.env.example](./.env.example) for the complete configuration template with detailed comments and setup instructions.

#### Key Requirements:
- **LLM Model**: `LLM_MODEL` - Choose your preferred model
- **LLM Provider**: At least one API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google)
- **Tool Provider**: `JENTIC_AGENT_API_KEY` for turn-key access to capabilities based on 1500+ APIs (get yours at [jentic.com](https://jentic.com))

### Usage Examples

*Standard Agent* includes pre-built agent classes for a quick-start, but you can also compose your own agent from scratch. Both approaches are shown below.

#### 1. Quick Start: Running a Pre-built Agent

This is the fastest way to get started. `ReWOOAgent` and `ReACTAgent` are subclasses of `StandardAgent` that are pre-configured with a reasoner, LLM, tools, and memory.

```python
# examples/cli_api_agent.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agents.prebuilt import ReWOOAgent, ReACTAgent
from examples._cli_helpers import read_user_goal, print_result

# Load API keys from .env file
load_dotenv()

# 1. Get the pre-built agent.
# Choose a prebuilt profile (ReWOO or ReACT)
agent = ReWOOAgent(model=os.getenv("LLM_MODEL"))
# agent = ReACTAgent(model=os.getenv("LLM_MODEL"))

# 2. Run the agent's main loop.
print("ü§ñ Agent is ready. Press Ctrl+C to exit.")
while True:
    goal_text = None
    try:
        goal = read_user_goal()
        if not goal:
            continue
        
        result = agent.solve(goal)
        print_result(result)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nü§ñ Bye!")
        break
```

#### 2. Custom: Compose Your Own Agent

The real power of *Standard Agent* comes from its **composable architecture**. Every component is swappable, allowing you to create custom agents tailored to your specific needs, without reimplementing a lot of code. Here's how to build agents from scratch by mixing and matching components.

```python
# main_build_your_own_agent.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Import the core agent class
from agents.standard_agent import StandardAgent

# Import different implementations for each layer
from agents.llm.litellm import LiteLLM
from agents.tools.jentic import JenticClient
from agents.memory.dict_memory import DictMemory

# Import reasoner components
from agents.reasoner.rewoo import ReWOOReasoner

from examples._cli_helpers import read_user_goal, print_result

load_dotenv()

# Step 1: Choose and configure your components
llm = LiteLLM(model="gpt-4")
tools = JenticClient()
memory = DictMemory()

# Step 2: Pick a reasoner profile (single-file implementation)
custom_reasoner = ReWOOReasoner(llm=llm, tools=tools, memory=memory)

# Step 3: Wire everything together in the StandardAgent
agent = StandardAgent(
    llm=llm,
    tools=tools,
    memory=memory,
    reasoner=custom_reasoner
)

# Step 4: Use your custom agent
print("ü§ñ Custom Agent is ready!")
while True:
    goal_text = None
    try:
        goal = read_user_goal()
        if not goal:
            continue
            
        result = agent.solve(goal)
        print_result(result)
        
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nü§ñ Bye!")
        break
```

## Architecture

*Standard Agent* provides a composable architecture that allows you to swap out different LLMs, reasoning strategies, memory backends, and tool providers. This allows you to:

- **Start simple** with pre-built agents like `ReWOOAgent`
- **Gradually customize** by swapping individual components
- **Experiment easily** with different LLMs, reasoning strategies, or tool providers
- **Extend incrementally** by implementing new components that follow the same interfaces
- **Mix and match** components from different sources without breaking existing code

Each component follows well-defined interfaces (`BaseLLM`, `BaseMemory`, `JustInTimeToolingBase`, etc.), so they can be combined in any configuration that makes sense for you.

|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent**        | `StandardAgent`                                                      | Owns Reasoner, LLM, Memory, and Tools                             |
| **Reasoners**    | `ReWOOReasoner`, `ReACTReasoner`                                      | Each orchestrates a different reasoning strategy (profile).       |
| **Memory**       | `MutableMapping`                                                         | A key-value store accessible to all components.                   |
| **Tools**        | `JustInTimeToolingBase`                                              | Abstracts external actions (APIs, shell commands, etc.).          |
| **LLM Wrapper**  | `BaseLLM`                                                            | Provides a uniform interface for interacting with different LLMs. |
| **Goal Preprocessor** | `BaseGoalPreprocessor`                                            | [Optional] Preprocess goals before reasoning                      |

### Reasoner Strategies

The library currently ships two reasoner strategies:

- **ReWOOReasoner** (`agents/reasoner/rewoo.py`): Plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Reflect  (arxiv [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18323))
- **ReACTReasoner** (`agents/reasoner/react.py`): Think ‚Üí Act (arxiv [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629))

Each profile exposes a `run(goal: str) -> ReasoningResult` and produces a `transcript`. The agent synthesizes the final answer from the transcript.

We note that there are broadly two ways to implement agentic reasoning:

- "Explicit" reasoning explicitly implements the reasoning strategy in the code that calls the LLM. ReWOO is more explicit.
- "Implicit" reasoning lets the LLM steer the reasoning strategy, informed only by the system prompt. ReACT is more implicit.

We welcome contributions of new reasoning strategies anywhere on this spectrum. If you add a profile, please keep it as a single module that implements the `BaseReasoner` class and define its prompts in YAML under `agents/prompts/reasoners/`.

### Extending the Library

The library is designed to be modular. Here are some common extension points:

| Need                               | How to Implement                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Different reasoning strategy**   | Create a new `BaseReasoner` implementation (e.g., `TreeSearchReasoner`) and inject it into `StandardAgent`.                                                                          |
| **New tool provider**              | Create a class that inherits from `JustInTimeToolingBase`, implement its methods, and pass it to your `StandardAgent`.                                                               |
| **Persistent memory**              | Create a class that implements the `MutableMapping` interface (e.g., using Redis), and pass it to your `StandardAgent`.                                                              |
| **New Planners, Executors, etc.**  | Create your own implementations of `Plan`, `ExecuteStep`, `Reflect`, or `SummarizeResult` to invent new reasoning capabilities, then compose them in a `SequentialReasoner`. |
| **Pre-process or validate goals**  | Create a class that inherits from `BaseGoalPreprocessor` and pass it to `StandardAgent`. Use this to resolve conversational ambiguities, check for malicious intent, or sanitize inputs. |
