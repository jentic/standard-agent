You are a planning assistant.  Given the user goal below, output a
*markdown bullet list* plan to achieve it.

Requirements:
• Each action is on its own line, starting with "- ".  Use 2 spaces
  per indentation level to indicate sub‑steps.
• Be concrete and include the target object and purpose.
• If a step's result should be kept for later, append "-> store:
  <key>" where <key> is a short variable name.
• For steps that might fail (e.g., finding an item), add a sub-bullet with a backup plan starting with `-> if fails:`.
• Do not mention any specific external tool names.
• Enclose ONLY the list in triple backticks.
• Always append the goal to the end of each step.

Example:
Goal: 'Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently'

```
- Find an appropriate api or workflow to use to achieve the goal ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
  - Search jentic for a 'nytimes' api ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
    -> if fails: Search jentic for a generic 'news' api.
  - Load execution info for the api which best suits the goal ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
    -> if fails: Try loading the next best tool from the search results.
- Execute the selected api operation or workflow -> store: nytimes_api_result ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
  -> if fails: Report that the API call failed.
- From the results, decide on an interesting article -> store: interesting_article ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
  -> if fails: Report that no articles were found.
- Extract the title, url, and summary from the article -> store: article_info ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
- Return the article information to the user ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
```

Current goal: find nyt articles on trump and send a 3 line summary on the articles you found to discord on channel 1387069669189488812

Provide ONLY a JSON object with the arguments for the call. DO NOT WRAP IN MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS.
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON object without any ```json or ``` markers.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

Note: Authentication credentials will be automatically injected by the platform.

Current goal: find nyt articles on trump and send a 3 line summary on the articles you found to discord on channel 1387069669189488812

Provide ONLY a JSON object with the arguments for the call. DO NOT WRAP IN MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS.
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON object without any ```json or ``` markers.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

Note: Authentication credentials will be automatically injected by the platform.

Provide ONLY a JSON object with the arguments for the call. DO NOT WRAP IN MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS.
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON object without any ```json or ``` markers.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

Note: Authentication credentials will be automatically injected by the platform.

1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

Provide ONLY a JSON object with the arguments for the call. DO NOT WRAP IN MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS.
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON object without any ```json or ``` markers.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

Note: Authentication credentials will be automatically injected by the platform.

You are a planning assistant.  Given the user goal below, output a
*markdown bullet list* plan to achieve it.

Requirements:
• Each action is on its own line, starting with "- ".  Use 2 spaces
  per indentation level to indicate sub‑steps.
• Be concrete and include the target object and purpose.
• If a step's result should be kept for later, append "-> store:
  <key>" where <key> is a short variable name.
• For steps that might fail (e.g., finding an item), add a sub-bullet with a backup plan starting with `-> if fails:`.
• Do not mention any specific external tool names.
• Enclose ONLY the list in triple backticks.
• Always append the goal to the end of each step.

Example:
Goal: 'Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently'

```
- Find an appropriate api or workflow to use to achieve the goal ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
  - Search jentic for a 'nytimes' api ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
    -> if fails: Search jentic for a generic 'news' api.
  - Load execution info for the api which best suits the goal ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
    -> if fails: Try loading the next best tool from the search results.
- Execute the selected api operation or workflow -> store: nytimes_api_result ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
  -> if fails: Report that the API call failed.
- From the results, decide on an interesting article -> store: interesting_article ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
  -> if fails: Report that no articles were found.
- Extract the title, url, and summary from the article -> store: article_info ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
- Return the article information to the user ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
```

Real:
