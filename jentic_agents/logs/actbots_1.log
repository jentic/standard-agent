You are a planning assistant.  Given the user goal below, output a
*markdown bullet list* plan to achieve it.

Requirements:
• Each action is on its own line, starting with "- ".  Use 2 spaces
  per indentation level to indicate sub‑steps.
• Be concrete and include the target object and purpose.
• If a step's result should be kept for later, append "-> store:
  <key>" where <key> is a short variable name.
• For steps that might fail (e.g., finding an item), add a sub-bullet with a backup plan starting with `-> if fails:`.
• Do not mention any specific external tool names.
• Enclose ONLY the list in triple backticks.
• Always append the goal to the end of each step.

Example:
Goal: 'Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently'

```
- Find an appropriate api or workflow to use to achieve the goal ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
  - Search jentic for a 'nytimes' api ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
    -> if fails: Search jentic for a generic 'news' api.
  - Load execution info for the api which best suits the goal ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
    -> if fails: Try loading the next best tool from the search results.
- Execute the selected api operation or workflow -> store: nytimes_api_result ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
  -> if fails: Report that the API call failed.
- From the results, decide on an interesting article -> store: interesting_article ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
  -> if fails: Report that no articles were found.
- Extract the title, url, and summary from the article -> store: article_info ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
- Return the article information to the user ( goal: Find an interesting nytimes article that came out recently )
```

Current goal: find nyt articles on trump and send a 3 line summary on the articles you found to discord on channel 1387069669189488812

Provide ONLY a JSON object with the arguments for the call. DO NOT WRAP IN MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS.
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON object without any ```json or ``` markers.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

Note: Authentication credentials will be automatically injected by the platform.

9. find-local-vehicle-inventory — Search for vehicle listings based on geographic location (Zip Code or GPS coordinates) and optionally filter by brand, model, year, etc.
10. find-menu-item-nutrition — Search for a menu item from a restaurant chain and retrieve its nutritional information.
11.  — Retrieve an array of names and locations, filtered by category, that begin with the query string passed in. Ideally used for search autocomplete dropdowns, as the search functionality filters against name and location. The four potential categories are: `conversations` for names of users you are in existing conversations with; `matches` for names of users you have previously skipped over; `people` for names of all other users; `locations` for locations of users. Only users and their locations who exist with the current access token's bubble are considered.
12. search for users — POST /search_users
13.  — Searches a site for any questions which fit the given criteria.
 
Search criteria are expressed using the following parameters:
  - q - a free form text parameter, will match all question properties based on an undocumented algorithm.
 - accepted - true to return only questions with accepted answers, false to return only those without. Omit to elide constraint.
 - answers - the minimum number of answers returned questions must have.
 - body - text which must appear in returned questions' bodies.
 - closed - true to return only closed questions, false to return only open ones. Omit to elide constraint.
 - migrated - true to return only questions migrated away from a site, false to return only those not. Omit to elide constraint.
 - notice - true to return only questions with post notices, false to return only those without. Omit to elide constraint.
 - nottagged - a semicolon delimited list of tags, none of which will be present on returned questions.
 - tagged - a semicolon delimited list of tags, of which at least one will be present on all returned questions.
 - title - text which must appear in returned questions' titles.
 - user - the id of the user who must own the questions returned.
 - url - a url which must be contained in a post, may include a wildcard.
 - views - the minimum number of views returned questions must have.
 - wiki - true to return only community wiki questions, false to return only non-community wiki ones. Omit to elide constraint.

  
At least one additional parameter must be set if nottagged is set, for performance reasons.
 
The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:
 - activity - last_activity_date
 - creation - creation_date
 - votes - score
 - relevance - matches the relevance tab on the site itself Does not accept min or max
  activity is the default sort.
 
 It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.

 
This method returns a list of questions.

14. Search for a WeGA entity — This endpoint returns the search results for an entity's name or title.

15. Search Restaurants — Search through thousands of restaurants (in North America) by location, cuisine, budget, and more.

Current goal: find nyt articles on trump and send a 3 line summary on the articles you found to discord on channel 1387069669189488812

Provide ONLY a JSON object with the arguments for the call. DO NOT WRAP IN MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS.
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON object without any ```json or ``` markers.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

Note: Authentication credentials will be automatically injected by the platform.

Current goal: find nyt articles on trump and send a 3 line summary on the articles you found to discord on channel 1387069669189488812

Provide ONLY a JSON object with the arguments for the call. DO NOT WRAP IN MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS.
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON object without any ```json or ``` markers.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

Note: Authentication credentials will be automatically injected by the platform.

Candidate tools discovered (reply with ONLY the *number* of the best match):
1. search-and-content-retrieval — Allows users to search for content (posts, topics, users, categories, tags, groups) using various query parameters and then retrieve the full details of a specific post or topic found in the search results.
2. scrape-all-search-results — Retrieves a large dataset matching a specific query by iterating through results using the scraping endpoint's cursor mechanism. Useful for bulk data collection or comprehensive analysis.
3. discover-local-trends — Allows a user to find geographical locations with trending topics closest to a specified coordinate and then retrieve the top trends for one of those locations.
4. iterative-restroom-search-by-criteria — This workflow guides a user through different methods of searching for restrooms, allowing them to progressively refine their approach based on their evolving needs. It starts with a location-based search, then offers a date-based search, and finally a general keyword search, catering to various user preferences for finding suitable restrooms.
5. get-video-search-suggestions — Provides autocomplete suggestions for a partial video search query, which can then be used in a full search.
6. search-paragraphs-and-view-section-content — Enables users to search for specific text within paragraphs, then locate the containing section using the paragraph reference, and finally retrieve the full content of that section for context.
7. search-movie-and-get-full-details — Allows a user to search for a movie by title, select a result, and then retrieve comprehensive details about that movie including general information, cast, reviews, and similar movie recommendations.
8. retrieve-serp-data — Submit one or more jobs to retrieve the full Search Engine Results Page (SERP) for specific keywords, then collect the detailed SERP data (organic results) once available. This is valuable for analyzing competitors and understanding the search landscape.
9. search-and-track-bill — Allows users to search for legislative bills using various criteria (e.g., jurisdiction, keyword, sponsor) and then retrieve comprehensive details about a specific bill, including its actions, sponsors, and associated documents. This workflow is essential for researchers, journalists, or advocacy groups tracking legislation.
10. refined-document-search — Allows users to perform an initial broad natural language query and then refine the search results by applying specific metadata filters (e.g., source, time period, author) in a subsequent query to narrow down the results. This addresses the need for more precise information retrieval by leveraging the filtering capabilities of the API.
11. Article Search — Article Search requests use the following URI structure:

12.  — GET /search.json
13.  — GET /reviews/search.json
14. Archive API — The Archive API provides lists of NYT articles by month going back to 1851.  Simply pass in the year and month you want and it returns a JSON object with all articles for that month.

15.  — GET /content.json

Current goal: find nyt articles on trump and send a 3 line summary on the articles you found to discord on channel 1387069669189488812

Provide ONLY a JSON object with the arguments for the call. DO NOT WRAP IN MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS.
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON object without any ```json or ``` markers.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

Note: Authentication credentials will be automatically injected by the platform.

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON object without any ```json or ``` markers.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

Note: Authentication credentials will be automatically injected by the platform.

Current goal: find nyt articles on trump and send a 3 line summary on the articles you found to discord on channel 1387069669189488812

Provide ONLY a JSON object with the arguments for the call. DO NOT WRAP IN MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS.
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON object without any ```json or ``` markers.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

Note: Authentication credentials will be automatically injected by the platform.

Current goal: find nyt articles on trump and send a 3 line summary on the articles you found to discord on channel 1387069669189488812

Provide ONLY a JSON object with the arguments for the call. DO NOT WRAP IN MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS.
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON object without any ```json or ``` markers.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract actual parameter values from the goal context when possible
2. For IDs extracted from URLs, parse the relevant parts (e.g., entity IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
3. **SMART MEMORY EXTRACTION**: When memory contains structured data (arrays, objects), extract specific values you need:
   - Find items by matching attributes
   - Extract the actual values from the matching items
   - DO NOT use placeholders when actual data is available in memory
4. Only use ${memory.<key>} placeholders for values that are explicitly listed above in available memory AND cannot be extracted
5. If a required parameter cannot be determined from the goal or memory, use a descriptive placeholder
6. Do NOT output markdown formatting - provide raw JSON only

Note: Authentication credentials will be automatically injected by the platform.
